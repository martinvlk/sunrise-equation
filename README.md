# sunrise-equation
This will calculate todays times of sunrise and sunset for a given location.

It currently uses hard coded location, but it is easy to change in the source
and rebuild using "cabal build".

I have just used this exercise to learn Haskell. Might make it more generic
later on.

sunrise-equation.cws is a Cantor/Octave worksheet I used to learn the algorithm
before implementing in Haskell.

The sources of the algorithms I used:
